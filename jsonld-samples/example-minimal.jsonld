    "description": "Fusion Lifestyle was established in April 2000 following a decision by a London Borough Council to outsource the management of the leisure facilities. Fusion now manages a diverse portfolio of facilities using our specialist expertise to provide sustainable solutions for councils and exciting products and programmes for our customers. Fusion is a national operator managing leisure facilities from Wales to London and as far north as Newcastle. \n\nNo two Fusion sites are the same, we retain the heritage of centres when we refurbish and we are experienced at managing centres from ice rinks to outward bound residential centres, town halls and expansive leisure facilities. We put our energies into providing facilities and programmes that are an attractive proposition to the local community. We respect the history of our centres and it is not uncommon for generations of local residents to hold fond memories of learning to swim in our centres, playing football matches over the years and hosting birthday celebrations at our sites.\n\nFusion is a registered charity, there are therefore no shareholders. We are able to continually reinvest in facilities, products and importantly people.\n",
